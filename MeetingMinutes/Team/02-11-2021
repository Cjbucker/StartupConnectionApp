## Topics Discussed

The team discussed how the work will be divvied out and where everyone will be working in the code. Jim and Chris will be working primarly in the backend to assure
that search endpoints are created for pitches. Julian and Robert will be working in the frontend assuring that searching for pitches will allow a user to click on the
search and go view the pitch. We had also discussed what are plans are for the next few days; after a successful iteration 3 we will take the weekend to ourselves and 
reconvene on monday to continue our work. 

## Things Clarified

What the goals for this iteration are and who is expected to work where. Assuring that our schedules are out there so the team knows when each person is avaliable. 
The short term goals for the halfway point of the iteration of having search mostly complete and moving towards cleaning pitch.
