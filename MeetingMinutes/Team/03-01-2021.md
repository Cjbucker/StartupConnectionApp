## Topics Discussed

The team met up for a work day, finishing up making Search work and resolving various errors that arose (namely search acting inconsitently and occasionally erroring out).
The team worked mainly as a group of 4 for this meeting, as the errors arose from both our frontend and backend, and had to deal partially with our routing and various variables.

## Things Clarified

The team discussed the work that still needed to be done, namely aesthetic changes to the pitch and the search bar.
