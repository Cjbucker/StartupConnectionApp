## Topics Dicussed

The first thing Evan did was create an Okta account and log into our website. This allowed him to take full advantage of the services we've implemented thus far. 
We showed Evan the new search functionality, including the User and Pitch radio boxes utilized for search filtering. Evan created a pitch and enjoyed our new aesthetic.  
He customized the pitch to test its different features. He then searched for the pitch using our search filters, and found it. 
Evan tested if he could access the pitch as an anonymous user as well, and he could.

## Topics Clarified

We decided to spend some of our time this iteration updating the aesthetics, especially near the end. 
This meant a fresher layout for the pitch page and radio boxes for the user and Pitch search filter buttons. Evan was impressed by what we had accomplished thus far, and thinks we'll do well next iteration. 
Peer programming has been exceedingly useful to us and we will continue to use it.
