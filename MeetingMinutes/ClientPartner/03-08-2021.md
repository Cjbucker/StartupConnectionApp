## Topics Discussed

Meeting with Trey and allowing him to interact directly with the website provided a great amount of information for the team. We had noticed various small design choices
that we wanted to change, such as choosing what to search by. Trey had also given us tips on how he thinks we could imrpove these asthetic choices through various means.

Overall Trey was happy with the progress the team had made and was talking about looking into hosting for himself. Trey also commented that he believes the team's priorities
were good for the fifth iteration, which was focused around getting messaging working and clearing some tech debt.

The final thing Trey left us with was SignalR could be something to use for our messaging portion. SignalR would allow the team to prevent the frontend from sending
multiple calls to get new messages or chats, instead the backend would send out a message indicating an update. This would allow for a more intelligent way of implementing
messaging rather than just pinging the database for new messages.

## Things Clarified

The team is headed in the right direction and looking to end strong. With the clarification that our fifth iteration goals align with what Trey wants.
