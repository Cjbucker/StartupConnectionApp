## Use Cases
* **UC1** Search for pitches.

  * To use this function the actor will locate the search function on the page and filter for the pitches their looking for by name.
  * Actors: Developer, Investor, System

* **UC2** Define keywords for pitch.
  * Certain keywords are associated with different types of pitches. Being able to define by keywords for a pitch during pitch creation is important because it gives it a category for interested users to search in. Investors will search for pitches they're interested in based on those keywords.

* **UC3** Filter profane and vulgar pitch keywords
  * Admins need the ability to filter out tags and pitch pages that use obscene and vulgar language or have a negative purpose. We want the application to allow adult content, but all within reason. Anything that isn't formal and decent should be able to be blocked or disabled from view by an admin.
  * An admin would go to the search page and either search for vulgar language in titles or by tags and disable them accordingly with buttons located on each pitch holder.

  * The founder needs to bring developers and investors into their pitch. They can accomplish through through formatting their pitch page in a way that attracts their target audience. Their pitch page should catch the attention of the intended audience quickly.
  * In order to format the pitch page it needs to be created first. Then, the founder would display the information where it needs to go through drag and drop. The founder may want slides in the middle of the pitch page, or page interactions in the upper right of the page. They will decide where items such as statstics are placed and the general information of the page.
  * Actors: Founder

Users need to be able to switch between roles so they can take on the different roles that are required of them per pitch.
  * Interchanging between user roles is fluid between it exists in the back-end to dictate functionality. The user is given the roles based on the tasks they perform. For example, if they click the Create Pitch tab they would then go through that process as a founder.

* **UC14** Manage investor payment processing.
  * This use case is critical to the software. managing investor payments is one of the most important tasks the software has since it serves as an intermediary between the different users. It tracks the investor payments so everyone is satisfied and the money goes to who its supposed to.
  * The investors give the money to the third party and  they hold it until the system is told by the administrator to disperse the money to the necessary parties.
  * Actors: System, administrator

* **UC15** Finish a given pitch.
  * This use case is necessary because the pitch should eventually be completed. Once the pitch is finished funds can be dispersed. The end goal of the pitch is to eventually reach this point.

  * Actors: Developer

* **UC16** process fund acquisition.
  * This use case stems from making sure the money is actaully being provided and the founder and developer don't get screwed over. When an investor funds a pitch, the system will detect that they did and mark a pitch as funded. At this point, the funds are in a secure location where the investor can't retract them (without special circumstances) and the money is guaranteed to the founder/developer.
  * This is done by an approved investment proposal by a founder being sent to an administrator to change the status of the pitch.
  * Actors: Administrators
  * BR5

* **UC17** process fund distribution.
  * Fund distribution when a pitch is in development is essential to ensure the developer gets paid for their work and the founder has money to advertise and build their business/idea. This will be done by an administrator marking a pitch in development and the third party distributing the money in the way agreed in the development proposals, if any.
  * This will be done similarly to the acquisition, where once a founder and investor (and developer) agree on terms, the pitch will transition into development and will be marked by an administrator as in development. The money will then be distributed accordingly.
  * Actors: Administrators
  * BR5

* **UC18** Change status of pitches.
  * Changing the status of a pitch is essential to knowing how far along an idea is and what is left to fulfill. An administrator will change the status of a pitch as investors and developers submit proposals and they are approved by the founder. This is to keep our system in order and middle-man for the pitch team.
  * This will be done by going to a pitch page as an administrator and choosing from a drop-down menu, switching the status on the public page.
  * Actors: Administrators
  * BR5

* **UC19** Negotiate terms of a pitch.
  * The ability to negotiate terms is important because it lets the different users involved in the process come to an agreement on pitch details. Once the different users come to agreement the pitch is complete and the pitch can move forward. Without this functionality, the users would find it difficult to come to an appropriate agreement on individual terms for the pitch. One way they will be able to negotiate is through the direct message functionality.
  * To negotiate terms of a pitch the users will navigate to the direct messages page. Here, they can choose who to negotiate with by sending a message to them.
  * Actors: User
  * BR6
* **UC20** Observe associated parties with the pitch.
  * The investor or developers will want to be able to see the parties associated with certain pitches to make an educated decision on if they want to be involved with them. By being able to observe associated parties with the pitch the investor or developer can determine their overall quality and if they're worth being involved with based on the pitch. It could be someone the investor or developer has worked with before so they can make a decision based on their previous experience with them.
  * The investor or developer will navigate to the pitch page. While there, they'll be able to see a contribution list of who has contributed to the pitch. They can click on each contributor to navigate to their profile and see more information about them.
  * Actors: Investor, Developer

* **UC21** Confirm pitch investment proposals.
  * A founder needs to be able to agree to the terms of an investment such as amount and terms stated by the investor. The founder should be able to do this with ease to ensure connections are established and the pitch can move forward.
  * The founder will go to their pitch page, under a widget labeled "proposals", they can select a proposal and choose to accept or decline it.
  * Actors: Founders
  * BR6

* **UC22** Confirm pitch development proposals.
  * The founder also needs to be able to agree to the tech-stack and payment terms discussed by the developer. This is huge when trying to find developers for your software and ensures their payment in the long run.
  * This will be done the same way as investment proposals.
